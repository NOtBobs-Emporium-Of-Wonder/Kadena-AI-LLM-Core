Kadena-AI-LLM-Core
Building the bridge between Kadena (Pact) and AI-Driven Development.

💡 The Vision
The Kadena AI LLM Core is a community-driven repository designed to provide high-quality training materials, context, and templates for Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal is to enable "Vibe Coding" on Kadena—allowing anyone, from seasoned developers to casual dreamers, to describe an idea in plain English and have AI generate reliable, secure, and deployable Pact code. By feeding AI the right "context packs," we remove the technical barriers to the Kadena ecosystem.

📦 What’s Inside?
This repository is organized into specific Learning Packs that you can feed into AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, or Windsurf:

Code Snippets: A library of "Gold Standard" Pact modules that are bug-free and formally verified.

Prompt Libraries: Specialized system prompts that "tune" an AI to act as a Senior Kadena Architect.

App Templates: 90%-ready boilerplates (Frontend + Smart Contract) designed for AI to fill in the final 10%.

API Context: Pre-mapped, reliable endpoints for Chainweb nodes to ensure AI connects to the network correctly.

Agent Logic: Data structures and documentation to help build a dedicated Kadena AI Agent.

🎯 Why This Matters
Pact is a unique, powerful language, but standard AI models often lack the specific training data to write it perfectly.

Accuracy: No more AI "hallucinations" or EVM/Solidity logic bleeding into Pact code.

Speed: Move from "Idea" to "Testnet" in minutes, not days.

Accessibility: Lowering the barrier to entry for the next generation of KDA builders.

🚀 How to Use This
Select a Pack: Choose the folder related to your project (e.g., NFT-Minter-Pack).

Feed the AI: Copy the .md or .txt files into your AI chat or add them to your AI's "Context" or "Knowledge Base."

Vibe Code: Use the provided prompts to start building.
